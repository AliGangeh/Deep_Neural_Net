# Deep_Neural_Net
I am creating a basic deep neural network to better understand their functionality.

This will be done through the keras library. I made use of a single layer dense network with 2 input nodes and 1 output nodes. Cross entropy is used to find error, and I made use of the sigmoid activation function, and the adam optimizer.
